# FlatIron-Mod3 Final 

For the Mod3 Final Project, I used a decision tree and random forest classifiers to see which features were most important in predicting whether flights would be late.  I used the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancelations dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays).  The dataset is very large, especially after it was one-hot encoded.  This was the largest challenge in the project, though using Google Colab Pro was very helpful.  

The files in the repository include the following: 
* index.ipynb (the code)
* README.md (this file)
* JLN Mod3 Final.key/.pdf (the nontechnical presentation slides)

The dataset is too large to load into Github; it may be downloaded at the link above.
